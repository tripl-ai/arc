- add `ConfigExecute` stage to allow dynamic creation of runtime variables.
- **FIX** revert `DiffTransform` and `EqualityValidate` to use `sha2(to_json(struct()))` rather than inbuilt Spark `hash` function due to high liklihood of collisions.

## 3.3.3

- rewrote the code to calculate `_index` (vs `_monotonically_increasing_id`) to be more efficient with large datasets.
- add optional `id` attribute to all stages which can be used to easily identify individual stages when monitoring logs.
- add the `schema` attribute to `TypingTransform` and `MetadataTransform` to allow inline schema. Can be disabled via `etl.policy.inline.schema` and `ETL_POLICY_INLINE_SCHEMA`. These are being trialed and if beneficial will be added to all stages that support schemas.

- This commit replaces the HashMap with the threadsafe ConcurrentHashMap
- **BREAKING** disable automatic dropping of unsupported types when performing `*Load` stages (e.g. `ParquetLoad` cannot support `NullType`). Old behavior can be enabled by setting `etl.policy.drop.unsupported`/`ETL_POLICY_DROP_UNSUPPORTED` to `true`.
- **BREAKING** remove deprecated `etl.config.environment.id` and `ETL_CONF_ENV_ID` in favor of `etl.config.tags` or `ETL_CONF_TAGS`.

## 3.0.0

- bump to Spark [3.0.0](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-0.html).
- bump to Hadoop [3.2.0](https://hadoop.apache.org/release/3.2.0.html).
- **FIX** `MLTransform` dropping all calculated columns when applying models which do not produce a prediction column.

- **BREAKING** move `XMLExtract` and `XMLLoad` to [arc-xml-plugin](https://github.com/triplai/arc-xml-plugin).
- **BREAKING** Spark ML models trained with Spark 2.x do not work with Spark 3.x and will need to be retrained (`MLTransform`).
- **BREAKING** remove `GraphTransform` and `CypherTransform` as the underlying [library](https://github.com/opencypher/morpheus) has been [abandoned](https://github.com/opencypher/morpheus/issues/943#issuecomment-610215881).

## 2.14.0

**This is the last release supporting `Scala 2.s11` given the release of `Spark 3.0` which only supports `Scala 2.12`.**

- add support for case-insensitive formatter (default `true`) to allow formatter `MMM` to accept `JUL` and `Jul` where case-sensitive will only accept `Jul`. Applies to `Date` and `Timestamp` schema columns. Boolean property `caseSensitive` can be used to set case-sensitive behavior.

- add `get_uri_filename_array` user defined function which returns the contents of a Glob/URI as an `Array[(Array[Byte], String)]` where the second return value is `filename`.
- remove `delay` versions of `get_uri` as this can be handled by target service.

## 2.12.0

- **FIX** prevent early validation failure of SQL statements which contain `${hiveconf:` or `${hivevar:`.
- add `get_uri_array` user defined function which returns the contents of a Glob/URI as an `Array[Array[Byte]]`.
- add `get_uri_array_delay` which is the same as `get_uri_array` but adds a delay in milliseconds to reduce DDOS liklihood.
- add `LogExecute` which allows logging to the Arc log similar to `SQLValidate` but without the success/fail decision.

## 2.11.0

- add ability to define the Arc [schema](https://arc.tripl.ai/schema/) with a `schema` key (`{"schema": [...]}`) so that common attributes can be defined using [Human-Optimized Config Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCON) (HOCON) functionality.
- add ability to define `regex` when parsing string columns to perform validation.
- remove mandatory requirement to supply `trim`, `nullReplacementValue` and `nullableValues` for [schema](https://arc.tripl.ai/schema/) that don't logically use them. This will not break existing configurations.
- change `DiffTransform` and `EqualityValidate` to use inbuilt Spark `hash` function rather than `sha2(to_json(struct()))`.

## 2.3.1

- will now throw exceptions if trying to use the Amazon `s3://` or `s3n://` protocols instead of `s3a://` as they have been deprecated by the Hadoop project, are no longer suppored in Hadoop 3.0+ and do not behave predictably with the Arc Amazon [Authentication](https://arc.tripl.ai/partials/#authentication) methods.
- will now throw clearer message when typing conversion fails on a non-nullable field (which means the job cannot logically proceed).

## 2.0.1

- update to [Spark 2.4.4](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-4-4.html).
- update to Scala `2.12.9`

## 2.0.0

Arc 2.0.0 is a major (breaking) change which has been done for multiple reasons:

- to support both `Scala 2.11` and `Scala 2.12` as they are not binary compatible and the Spark project is moving to `Scala 2.12`. Arc will be published for both `Scala 2.11` and `Scala 2.12`.
- to decouple stages/extensions reliant on third-party packages from the main repository so that Arc is not dependent on a library which does not yet support `Scala 2.12` (for example).
- to support first-class plugins by providing a better API to allow the same type-safety when reading the job configuration as the core Arc pipeline stages (in fact all the core stages have been rebuilt as included plugins). This extends to allowing version number specification in stage resolution.

**BREAKING**

**REMOVED**

- remove `AzureCosmosDBExtract` stage. This could be reimplemented as a [Lifecycle Plugin](https://tripl-ai.github.io/arc/extend/#lifecycle-plugins).

- remove `DatabricksSQLDWLoad`. This could be reimplemented as a  [Lifecycle Plugin](https://tripl-ai.github.io/arc/extend/#lifecycle-plugins).
- remove `bulkload` mode from `JDBCLoad`. Any target specific JDBC behaviours could be implemented by a custom plugins if required.
- remove `user` and `password` from `JDBCExecute` for consistency. Move details to either `jdbcURL` or `params`.

- added `partitionColumn` to `JDBCExtract` to support parallel extract.
- added `predicates` to `JDBCExtract` to allow manual partition definitions.
- changed `XMLExtract` to be able to support reading `.zip` files.
- changed `*Extract` to allow input `glob` patterns not just simple `URI`.
- changed `*Extract` to support the schema to be provided as `schemaView`.
- added `BytesExtract` to allow `Array[Bytes]` to be read into a dataframe for things like calling external Machine Learning models.
- refactored `TensorFlowServingTransform` to call the `REST` API (in batches) which is easier due to library conflicts creating `protobuf`.
- create the `UDF` registration mechanism allowing logical extension point for common functions missing from Spark core.

## 1.0.8

- added the `KafkaLoad` stage - a stage which will write a dataset to a designated `topic` in Apache Kafka.
- added the `EXPERIMENTAL` `KafkaExtract` stage - a stage which will read from a designated `topic` in Apache Kafka and produce a dataset.
- added the `KafkaCommitExecute` stage - a stage which allows the commiting of the Kafka offsets to be deferred allowing quasi-transactional behaviour.
- added integration tests for `KafkaLoad` and `KafkaExtract`. more to come.
- added `partitionBy` to `*Extract`.
- added `contiguousIndex` option to file based `*Extract` which allows users to opt out of the expensive `_index` resolution from `_monotonically_increasing_id`.
- added ability to send a `POST` request with `body` in `HTTPExtract`.
- changed hashing function for `DiffTransform` and `EqualityValidate` from inbuilt `hash` to `sha2(512)`.

## 1.0.7

- added the `DiffTransform` stage - a stage which efficiently calculutes the difference between two datasets and produces left, right and intersection output views.
- added logging of `records` and `batches` counts to the `AzureEventHubsLoad`.
- updated the `EqualityValidate` to use the `hash` diffing function as the inbuilt `except` function is very difficult to use in practice. API unchanged.
- updated the `HTTPExecute` stage to not automatically split the response body by newline (`\n`) - this is more in line with expected usecase of REST API endpoints.

## 1.0.6

- updated `AzureEventHubsLoad` to use a SNAPSHOT compiled JAR in `/lib` to get latest changes. this will be changed back to Maven once version is officially released. Also exposed the expontential retry options to API.
- initial testing of a `.zip` reader/writer.

## 1.0.5

- **FIX** a longstanding defect in `TypingTranform` not correctly passing through values which are already of correct type.
- change the `_index` field added to `*Extract` from `monotonically_increasing_id()` to a `row_number(monotonically_increasing_id())` so that the index aligns to underlying files and is more intuitive to use.

## 1.0.4

- allow passing of same metadata schema to `JSONExtract` and `XMLExtract` to reduce cost of schema inference for large number of files.

## 1.0.3

- Expose numPartitions Optional Parameter for `*Extract`.

## 1.0.2

- add sql validation step to `SQLValidate` configuration parsing and ensure parameters are injected first (including `SQLTransform`) so the statements with parameters can be parsed.

## 1.0.1

- bump to Spark [2.3.1](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-1.html).

## 1.0.0

- initial release.
